        <h1>Alex Levy's Biography</h1>
        <main>
        <p>Of all the areas in design I am interested in (such as UI/UX design, motion design, graphic design, and immersive design), <strong>UI/UX design is the area I am most passionate about.</strong> I have a wide variety of skills, including video editing, design, and even basic coding. I have helped design the user interface for a project that won a hackathon section, designed infographics for an advertising campaign, and am currently one of the designers on the planning committee for a student-run hackathon.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies and work, I love learning and creating new things, such as experimenting with 3D modeling and visual effects. I also enjoy winding down with a good show (my favorite show is Burn Notice, which I have rewatched multiple times).</p>
