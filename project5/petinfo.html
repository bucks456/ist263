        <h1>Pet information</h1>
        <p>Because there are so many types of pets, it can be overwhelming to choose which one to get. Here is an overview of common types of pets.</p>

            <h2>Dogs</h2>
            <div>
                <p>According to Pet Helpful, dogs are the most popular pet in the United States (https://pethelpful.com/pet-ownership/10-Most-Common-Pets-In-The-US). While dogs are extremely loyal companions and friends (hence the nickname, “man's best friend”), they require a lot of care. First, it is recommended that you adopt a dog instead of buying one. If you are getting a puppy, they will require even more care than an adult dog would need. According to PetMD (https://www.petmd.com/dog/care/responsible-pet-owners-checklist-taking-care-pet), you will need to take your dog on daily walks. This helps them get exercise, go to the bathroom, and stay healthy. Make sure you have a leash and keep a close eye on your dog while on walks. It's also important that you train your dog. Training your dog can help keep them safe, such as when you are on a walk and you want your dog to come back to you. Finally, make sure you take the time to play with your dog. Dogs are social creatures with a lot of energy, and playing helps them both physically, socially, and mentally. Make sure you are having fun as well!

            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Cats are another popular pet to own. While they don't require as much direct care as dogs, they still need love and care. Cats can be pretty independent. They clean themselves often (which is why they occasionally cough up a hairball), but according to the ASPCA (https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/general-cat-care), it is still important to brush them yourself (which can reduce the number of hairballs they cough up). Make sure to give your cat name-brand cat food and clean water. The ASPCA recommends that you don't let your cat roam around outside. They could fight with other cats, get hurt or killed by other animals, or get bitten by ticks and fleas, which is why indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats. Even so, make sure you are providing your indoor cat with adequate stimulation. For example, you should provide your cat with a scratching post. This not only benefits the cat, but also makes it less likely that they will tear up your furniture. Cats might not always be as social as dogs, but they can be great friends!</p>

            <h2>Fish</h2>
            <div>
                <p>According to PetMD (https://www.petmd.com/fish/care/evr_fi_how-to-care-of-fish), while fish are generally easier to take care of than other pets, that doesn't mean there isn't much work involved. One important in taking care of a fish compared to other animals is that a fish requires an aquarium or tank that needs to be cleaned regularly. While a dog can live in a messy house, a fish needs a clean tank to stay healthy. It is also important not to overfeed your fish because they don't know when to stop eating. Only feed fish as much as they can eat in one or two minutes (the specific timing depends on the type of fish). An automatic fish feeder can help regulate the amount of food they receive. Finally, even though you can't physically interact with your fish, there are still ways to give them a fun home to live in. For example, you can decorate their tank with plants or fun objects.</p>

            <h2>Snakes</h2>
            <div>
                <p>While many people fear snakes, they can be great (and harmless) pets. That being said, it is important to take special care of snakes, as they are a lot different than pets such as dogs. According to PetMD (https://www.petmd.com/reptile/care/evr_rp_first_snake), some good snakes to start out with are the corn snake, ball python, and kingsnake. Make sure you do the research beforehand on taking care of a snake and determining what type of snake you want to get. Ball pythons can live for 20-30 years, which is probably something you would want to know before getting one. It's also important to keep safety in mind when handling snakes, as they can carry diseases. Make sure you wash your hands after touching your snake. For your snake's living environment, make sure the tank is at the proper temperature and humidity for the snake species you have. Finally, some pet snakes like to eat live prey, such as mice. Be prepared to do this, but you may be able to train your snake to eat a frozen and reheated dead mouse. If you don't like the thought of feeding an actual mouse or small animal to your pet, then a snake might not be for you. And remember to always be careful when feeding or handling your snake, as they can bite.</p>
