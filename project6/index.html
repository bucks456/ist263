        <h2>Why should I have a pet?</h2>
        <div class="petBenefits">
            <p class="description">Pet ownership comes with many benefits, both for yourself and the animal you will be taking care of.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the CDC, pet ownership comes with health benefits, such as decreased blood pressure, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. The CDC also says that pet ownership helps you increase your outdoor activity (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/keeping-pets-and-people-healthy/how.html">CDC</a>).</li>
                <li>CNN reports that pets can decrease stress in their owners during anxious events and put you in a better mood (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/health/benefits-of-having-a-pet-wellness/index.html">CNN</a>).</li>
                <li>Owning a pet allows you to give an animal a loving home that they otherwise would not have.</li>

                    <p>As someone who lives by himself in a rural area, having a dog has given me companionship through both good times and bad. Whenever I get sad, anxious, or lonely, my dog somehow senses it and rushes to cheer me up. In fact, he brings me so much joy that I am thinking about adopting another dog not only for myself, but also to give him a friend to play with when I'm at work.</p>

                    <p>My cats are a special part of my life. Wherever I go in the house, my cats follow. When I'm watching TV, they'll jump up on the couch and watch with me. When I go to bed, they'll curl up by my feet. When I go to sit down at my desk to work, there will be a cat on my lap right as I sit down. The bond we share is truly special.</p>
